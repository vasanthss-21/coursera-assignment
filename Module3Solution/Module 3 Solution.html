                <p class="s-style">Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that has gained global popularity for its unique combination of flavors and presentation.

Wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger often accompany sushi to enhance its taste. The preparation of sushi is considered an art form, requiring skill and precision. Sushi chefs, known as itamae, undergo years of training to perfect their craft. Traditionally, sushi emphasizes fresh, high-quality ingredients and minimalistic presentation. Modern variations of sushi have emerged, incorporating non-traditional ingredients and fusion styles, making sushi a versatile and continually evolving culinary delight.
